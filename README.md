I've been designing and developing web applications, for over 21 years. My core skills and knowledge consist of project requirements gathering, designing user-centred solutions and development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  In recent years, I have also acquired experience of React, Svelte and Vue.

Eaerly in my career  gained experience of using ColdFusion, ASP.Net (c#) and SQL, but now prefer a Front-end Stack.


 I firmly believe in the power of collaboration, and I enjoy working with others to develop excellent solutions. I‚Äôm particularly keen to work on impactful projects.

Continuous professional development is important to me, and I continue to learn and grow.
